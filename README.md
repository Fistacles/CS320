How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
    To ensure that your work is functional and secure, a developer has to constantly be reviewing and running tests on their code to make sure that it
    is working as intended. Running the code, or just the piece that you wish to test at the time, should be done frequently. Running it through VSCode or 
    Eclipse is a great way to see if something is wrong as it keeps track of incorrect lines or unfinished code. JUnits also work very well to make sure what 
    you are testing is functioning and that your standards are met.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
    It's important to read through the requests of the customer multiple times to ensure that you understand what they are looking for. If something is not
    clear in the instructions, you need to ask for clarification to avoid and issue that could come up. When requests change, you need to be able to integrate
    the new request into the software without breaking the entire thing, which is where the frequent testing comes in. It's important to work piecemeal on
    projects to ensure that each requirement is met without losing track of it and jumping to the next one.

How do I approach Designing software?
    I approach designing software as several different projects rather than just a single one. I break down the request into segments so I can mentally put
    my efforts into one part without being distracted or overwhelmed by the full scope of the project. One one piece of the software has been coded and 
    tested properly, I move onto the next. This is mostly done to keep things manageable for myself and helps organize what I'm doing.
